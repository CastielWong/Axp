Parking Expiations Issued by Adelaide City Council,"This dataset includes all parking expiations issued by the Adelaide City Council, and includes data such as payments, current status and exemptions for all parking expiations issued during the last three years.
The dataset is refreshed on the 6th day of every month and includes data up to the end of the previous month. The data is re-written each month as statuses etc. do change for expiations issued during the period.  The data is valid as of the date the extract is run.

FAQs

Why is the amount paid greater than the Expiation Amount?
The expiation amount is the amount of the original Expiation Fee on the date the Expiation Fee is issued.  After this time additional fees such as Reminder Fees, Search Fees and some others can be incurred which are added to the Expiation. 
All Expiation Fees, Reminder Fees, Search Fees etc. are set by the State Government.

What is FERU?
FERU is the Fines Enforcement and Recovery Unit, who are responsible for the recovery and enforcement of unpaid Expiations.  If an Expiation Remains unpaid Council will refer the matter to FERU to recover the debt.  Expiations can also be referred to FERU when a payment plan is entered into.  
When an Expiation has been referred to FERU the Offence Balance in the data is $0.

Why is the Offence Balance a negative figure?
On some occasions Adelaide City Council receives payments (either one or multiple payments) in excess of the amount payable for an Expiation. Council has a procedure in place to identify these payments and try to return the money.

By being counted annually, Super Tuesday helps track long-term patterns and identifies tangible results from network improvements. This count supplements the City of Adelaide cordon counts (undertaken each October by Adelaide City Council and the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure) and the permanent counters, which are located at six locations on the edges of the city.

Crime Mapper: Historical data,"Crime Mapper is an online application that provides the geographic distribution of recorded crime across South Australia. Two units of measurement are reported: 1. Number of offences - provides a count of all offences listed on all incident reports recorded by South Australia Police . 2. Rate per 1,000 estimated resident population - provides the number of offences as a rate per 1,000 population residing in each given location. Offences are categorised as follows:  Offences against the person (homicide; major assault; other);  Sexual offences (rape; indecent assault; unlawful sexual intercourse; other);  Robbery and extortion offences (armed robbery; unarmed robbery; extortion);  Offences against property (serious criminal trespass/break and enter; fraud and misappropriation; receiving/illegal possession of stolen goods; larceny/illegal use of a motor vehicle; other larceny; larceny from shops; larceny from a motor vehicle; arson/explosives; property damage and environmental offences);  Offences against good order;  Drug offences (possess/use drugs; sell/trade drugs; produce/manufacture drugs; possess implement for drug use; other);  Driving offences (driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs; dangerous driving; driving licence offences; traffic offences; motor vehicle registration offences; other); or  Other offences. When using Crime Mapper it is important to understand that the statistics it contains may not provide an accurate measure of the true prevalence or incidence of crime in a community.

When using Crime Mapper it is important to understand that the statistics it contains may not provide an accurate measure of the true prevalence or incidence of crime in a community.  Crime Mapper statistics represent only those offences reported to police or which come to the attention of police.  They can, therefore, be influenced by a number of factors, including victim reporting rates, the identification or detection of offences by police (in the case of victimless crimes) and police interpretation and decision as to whether a crime has occurred.  In addition, Crime Mapper does not include offences that are dealt with by way of expiation (e.g., speeding, littering, etc.).

When using Crime Mapper it is important to understand that the statistics it contains may not provide an accurate measure of the true prevalence or incidence of crime in a community.  Crime Mapper statistics represent only those offences reported to police or which come to the attention of police.  They can, therefore, be influenced by a number of factors, including victim reporting rates, the identification or detection of offences by police (in the case of victimless crimes) and police interpretation and decision as to whether a crime has occurred.  In addition, Crime Mapper does not include offences that are dealt with by way of expiation (e.g., speeding, littering, etc.).

They can, therefore, be influenced by a number of factors, including victim reporting rates, the identification or detection of offences by police (in the case of victimless crimes) and police interpretation and decision as to whether a crime has occurred. In addition, Crime Mapper does not include offences that are dealt with by way of expiation (e.g., speeding, littering, etc.).

2.	Rate per 1,000 estimated resident population - provides the number of offences as a rate per 1,000 population residing in each given location.
Offences are categorised as follows:
	Offences against the person (homicide; major assault; other);
	Sexual offences (rape; indecent assault; unlawful sexual intercourse; other);
	Robbery and extortion offences (armed robbery; unarmed robbery; extortion);
	Offences against property (serious criminal trespass/break and enter; fraud and misappropriation; receiving/illegal possession of stolen goods; larceny/illegal use of a motor vehicle; other larceny; larceny from shops; larceny from a motor vehicle; arson/explosives; property damage and environmental offences);
	Offences against good order;
	Drug offences (possess/use drugs; sell/trade drugs; produce/manufacture drugs; possess implement for drug use; other);
	Driving offences (driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs; dangerous driving; driving licence offences; traffic offences; motor vehicle registration offences; other); or
	Other offences.
When using Crime Mapper it is important to understand that the statistics it contains may not provide an accurate measure of the true prevalence or incidence of crime in a community.  Crime Mapper statistics represent only those offences reported to police or which come to the attention of police.  They can, therefore, be influenced by a number of factors, including victim reporting rates, the identification or detection of offences by police (in the case of victimless crimes) and police interpretation and decision as to whether a crime has occurred.  In addition, Crime Mapper does not include offences that are dealt with by way of expiation (e.g., speeding, littering, etc.).

Recent Air Quality,"The EPAs recent air quality data is a RSS feed that includes hourly average pollutant concentrations for ozone (ppm), carbon monoxide (ppm), nitrogen dioxide (ppm), sulfur dioxide (ppm), particles (PM10) (g/m3), fine particles (PM2.5) (g/m3) and station index (station air quality index or AQI) for 13 EPA monitoring sites. 

The station index is a descriptive scale that indicates the quality of air based on a comparison between pollutant concentrations and the relevant national standards. The station index determines the station air quality which is described as either very good, good, fair, poor or very poor. If the air quality is classified as poor, then one or more pollutants in the air have exceeded the national standard.

"Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-1915","##Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-1915

In August 1914 war broke out across Europe. Within days enemy subjects in Australia were required to register with the authorities. Most gave their parole and went on with their lives in the community, but internment started with sailors taken off enemy ships and enemy reservists, and went on to include enemy subjects suspected of disloyal or unsatisfactory behaviour. Later, some naturalised British subjects and even natural-born British subjects were interned. In the course of the war over 6,000 enemy subjects were interned across Australia. 

This dataset contains information about individuals interned during the First World War from South Australia (Military District 4). Most of those interned between October 1914 and August 1915, some 400 men, were held on Torrens Island, in the Port River estuary, north-west of Adelaide. The data set also includes those from South Australia who were interned in New South Wales after Torrens Island internment camp closed in August 1915.

The data was compiled by History SA staff from two archival series in the National Archives of Australia: A367 C18000 Part 1, War Internees and Deportees 1914-1919 and D2286, Nominal Roll of prisoners of war interned at Torrens Island concentration camp 1915. Data fields include: Name, Also recorded as (alternative name), Date interned, Interned (at), Nationality, Date of birth/age, Remarks, and Notes. The data has been produced by identifying individuals who appear in both series and combining information from both series into this data set, using the A367 data as the primary series. This involved interpreting the data, in particular, making an assessment of whether or not entries in the two series with similar names represent the same person. Further research may reveal some of these assessments to be inaccurate.

The dataset was produced as part of research for an exhibition at the Migration Museum and the Wakefield Press publication Interned: Torrens Island, 1914-15.

Bushfire Safer Places,"A Bushfire Safer Place is a place of relative safety and may be used as a place for people to stay in or as a place of first resort for those people who have decided that they will leave high risk locations early on a bad fire weather day.

Properties on the outskirts of such locations generally face a higher level of risk when compared with those nearer the center of the designated area. The relative safety of these properties can be improved by property owners undertaking appropriate bushfire safety works to ensure they don't place themselves and the greater community at risk.

A Bushfire Safer Place is relatively safe from bushfire because:

It is located in an area of generally low levels of bushfire fuel;
It is sufficiently distant from continuous bushland or forest to reduce the risk of sparks and embers;
Bushfire travel will be interrupted by:
Established gardens and lawns;
Road networks and other low fuel areas;
There is likely to be access to emergency, health and other community services.
If your Bushfire Survival Plan includes relocating to a Bushfire Safer Place you should:

Identify where your nearest Bushfire Safer Place is and if there are extra suitable alternatives;
Work out how you will get there and if there are any alternative routes to take;
Work out how long it will take you to get there;
Decide under what circumstances you will relocate and what your trigger points for action will be;
Plan for your relocation; when, where and what you will take etc.
The CFS recommends that if you intend to relocate to a Bushfire Safer Place you should do so early in the day. Last minute decisions to relocate in the face of fire are extremely dangerous.

Will you be safe in a Bushfire Safer Place?

There are no guarantees regarding your safety if you choose to stay in a Bushfire Safer Place or if you relocate to one. However it is unlikely you will be exposed to direct flame or severe radiant heat. You may be exposed to spark, embers and smoke, secondary fires may start in vegetation, gardens and structures from these sparks and embers. Therefore it is important to remember that even if your property is located within a Bushfire Safer Place you should prepare your home and undertake appropriate bushfire hazard management on your property.",dataset,English,Creative Commons Attribution,active,Hosted,annually,/dataset/00ccaac9-d75a-45ad-a6b2-8a9d70d46aa3,2016-08-04T00:10:00.361464,2016-08-04T00:10:51.716194,peter.freeman@sa.gov.au,,2016/8/1,Current,South Australia,Government of South Australia,data.sa.gov.au,SA Country Fire Service,"bushfire, community, education, emergency, evacuation, fire, road safety, safer place, transport",Emergency and safety,Johan

South Australian Museum - Australian Helminthological Collection,"The Australian Helminthological Collection (AHC) of the South Australian Museum includes approximately 42,000 registered lots of helminths (e.g. nematodes, tapeworms, and other parasitic flatworms).  Most helminths in the collection are from Australian native vertebrates, but there is material from Australian domestic and zoo animals, livestock and humans and from hosts collected overseas.  Many of the worms in this collection were donated by one of Australias most famous parasitologists and zoologists, Professor T. Harvey Johnston.  Some of Johnstons specimens were collected when he travelled to Antarctica as Chief Zoologist with Sir Douglas Mawson in 1929 as part of the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expeditions.  
Material is either kept in bottles of ethanol or mounted on microscope slides.  The AHC is used frequently by researchers and students, nationally and internationally, for taxonomic and biodiversity studies.

Other strengths of the collection include South Australian arid zone native mammals, many specimens of extinct species such as the thylacine and large numbers of bat species.

The collection has also historical importance as it includes many specimens from early expeditions in Australia and to the subantarctic Islands and Antarctica. Well-known people such as Sir Douglas Mawson, Edgar R. Waite and Hedley Finlayson have contributed to the collection.

The mammal collection includes sub-fossils and remains from owl pellets. This collection consists entirely of Australian material with 20000 - 25000 specimens covering 76 mammal species (including introduced species). The collection is made up of bulk bone deposits from the floor of caves, bones excavated from sinkholes, bones extracted from predator scats (eg. dingoes, foxes and Ghost Bats), pellets from birds of prey, particularly barn owls (both recent and pre-settlement material), and stick nest rat nests and middens. The sub-fossil collection is the second best of its kind in Australia.

Investigating the effects of moving plants around a greenhouse,"The Australian Plant Phenomics Facility (APPF) is a national, collaborative, scientific research facility and provides state-of-the-art phenotyping tools and expertise to help academic and commercial plant scientists understand and relate the performance of plants to their genetic make-up.

The objective of the experiment was to assess the effects of different practices of plant movement within a Smarthouse on plant growth and plant to plant variance. Plants remaining in the same position were compared to those that progressed to different positions during the experiment. The Plant Accelerators smarthouses are greenhouses with a conveyor system that allows plants to be moved, imaged and watered. The conveyors are divided into lanes and positions within the lane. The dataset contains the output from image analysis for each plant photo over time. The associated images are also available.
